## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
Installation of Python 3, Numpy, Pandas Matplotlib, Seaborn libraries are sufficient to run the codes in the notebook. 

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
For this project, I was interested in analyzing the tweets during the #ENDSARS protest in Nigeria and also getting sentiments of the tweets.

## Data Source <a name="source"></a>
The data for this project was scrapped from the internet for tweets with the #ENDSARS hashtag between 20th October and 30th October 2020. The original csv is not uploaded here because of the size. Data has 553744 unique tweets, and 23 columns.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
There is one note book file that contains the exploratory data analysis and sentiment analysis. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the process for individual steps

## Results <a name="results"></a>
The main findings and answers to the questions can be found on a blog post [here](https://uforodavid.medium.com/endsars-protest-tweets-analysis-57f87bf7e0d7)
